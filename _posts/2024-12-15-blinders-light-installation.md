The "Blinders" light installation transforms old industrial lights into striking stage lights.
By repurposing time-worn fixtures, we create a fusion of vintage character and modern
technology that enhances any performance or event.

Old industrial lights are revitalized with a powerful 500W halogen lamp,
providing robust illumination. An LED pixel ring is integrated directly
 into the lampâ€™s reflector, directing dynamic light effects inward. This fusion not only enhances the visual impact but also preserves the original, rugged aesthetic of the fixture.

## Technical Details

At the heart of each Blinder is a custom-designed PCB running a modified version of WLED.
It has been modifed to support dmx input, RDM and to control the dimmer for the halogen bulb.
Most of the changes done to WLED during this project have since been pushed upstream and are now part of the WLED software.
