title: 'Blinders: Industrial Lights Turned Stage Lights'

The "Blinders" light installation transforms old industrial lights into striking stage lights.
By repurposing time-worn fixtures, we create a fusion of vintage character and modern
technology that enhances any performance or event.

Old industrial lights are revitalized with a powerful 500W halogen lamp,
providing robust illumination. An LED pixel ring is integrated directly
into the lamp’s reflector, directing dynamic light effects inward. This fusion not only enhances the visual impact but also preserves the original, rugged aesthetic of the fixture.

We save these lamps from the trash and upcycle them to give them a second life.
The Blinders project began in 2022 and is still ongoing – from time to time, we find
more discarded lights and convert them, continually expanding our collection.

## Technical Details

At the heart of each Blinder is a custom-designed PCB running a modified version of WLED.
It has been modified to support DMX input, RDM, and to control the dimmer for the halogen bulb.
Most of the changes made during this project have since been pushed upstream and are now part of the official WLED software.

Each blinder is fitted with an extra M10 eyebolt for more versatile hanging options and to attach a safety.
