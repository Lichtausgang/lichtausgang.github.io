The "Ringe" art installation is a captivating blend of minimalism and flexibility, designed to transform any space with its unique light patterns. Inspired by the simplicity of geometric shapes, "Ringe" consists of a series of illuminated rings that can be arranged in various configurations to create different visual effects.

The installation is highly adaptable, allowing it to be customized to fit the specific dimensions and aesthetic of the environment in which it is placed. Each ring emits a soft, ambient light that enhances the atmosphere without overwhelming it. The use of high-quality materials ensures that "Ringe" is not only visually striking but also durable and long-lasting.

"Ringe" is more than just a light installation; it is an interactive experience. Viewers are encouraged to engage with the piece, exploring the interplay of light and shadow as they move around it. This dynamic interaction creates a sense of connection between the viewer and the installation, making each encounter with "Ringe" unique.

Whether displayed in a gallery, a public space, or a private residence, "Ringe" brings a touch of elegance and sophistication to any setting. Its minimalist design and flexible configuration options make it a versatile addition to any art collection or interior design project.

## Technical Details

"Ringe" is composed of 30 rings, each embedded with 120 individually addressable LED pixels. These pixels can be controlled via artnet or sACN.

Each ring consists of two half-rings, which can also be hung individually. The frame of each ring is made from a recycled bicycle rim, while the lampshade is constructed from polycarbonate. The connecting clips are made from B1-PETG.

To allow for flexible hanging, two ring screws are attached to the inner side of each half-ring. Additionally, two M8 threads are embedded in the back of the clips, enabling the attachment of theater hooks (C-hooks, Manfrotto, etc.).

All materials used meet at least the B1 fire protection class.
