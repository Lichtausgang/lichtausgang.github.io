The "Ringe" art installation is a captivating blend of minimalism and flexibility, designed to transform any space with its unique light patterns. Inspired by the simplicity of geometric shapes, "Ringe" consists of a series of illuminated rings that can be arranged in various configurations to create different visual effects.

The installation is highly adaptable, allowing it to be customized to fit the specific dimensions and aesthetic of the environment in which it is placed. Each ring emits a soft, ambient light that enhances the atmosphere without overwhelming it. 

## Technical Details

"Ringe" is composed of 30 rings, each embedded with 120 individually addressable LED pixels. These pixels can be controlled via artnet or sACN.

Each ring consists of two half-rings, which can also be hung individually. The frame of each ring is made from a recycled bicycle rim, while the lampshade is constructed from polycarbonate. The connecting clips are made from B1-PETG.

To allow for flexible hanging, two ring screws are attached to the inner side of each half-ring. Additionally, two M8 threads are embedded in the back of the clips, enabling the attachment of theater hooks (C-hooks, Manfrotto, etc.).

All materials used meet at least the B1 fire protection class.
